# My Python-Finance Project

During Covid and WFM life style, I wanted to learn more about a programming language. I invested time into learning Python. I enjoyed learning and wanted to apply the basics to a project. Like many 20 something I've been spending free time investing and learning about trading. I took interest in Technical Analysis, also known as TA. I wanted to create a project that took my interests and combined them into a functioning class.

I view this project as something of a precursor to what could be a better script for automatically generating analysis for a symbol based on simple inputs. I work on it to that end.
